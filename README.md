### Melissa, from Boston!
 
My work involves helping people automate business processes with the Microsoft Power Platform :monocle_face:.  I also have a decent amount of front-end web development experience.

I'm currently learning Japanese, maybe I can eventually understand what they are saying in NJPW. 

My hobbies include cooking and fitness, though I'm pretty beginner level at both even after years into it :laughing:

Thanks for stopping by. :vulcan_salute:
